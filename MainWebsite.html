                <p>But we do know what happened when the two men held a joint press conference on Monday. Journalists bluntly conveyed shock at what they had just witnessed.
                That shock and concern continued to dominate the coverage a full 24 hours later. The White House stayed mostly silent and by midday on Tuesday, there
                was still no afternoon press briefing on the daily schedule.                    
                Even some of the president's biggest boosters on Fox News conceded that Trump had made a big mistake in Helsinki.
                "I will say this to the President," "Fox & Friends" co-host Brian Kilmeade said Tuesday morning. "When Newt Gingrich, when General Jack Keane, 
                when Matt Schlapp say the President fell short and made our intelligence apparatus look bad, I think it's time to pay attention."
                Kilmeade claimed it was "easily correctable."
                That's debatable. The tone of Monday and Tuesday's news coverage suggested that there will be long memories of Monday's press conference.
